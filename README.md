# MathGame
Math Game to practice basic calculus for kids in elementary school.
I created this as my first JavaScript Project.
Output language is German, but can easily be changed. 

**This game**
- prompts a randomly generated math addition or substraction exercise with numbers between 0 and 20
- no exercises with results greater than 20 or less than 0 
- feedback to user if the result is correct or not
